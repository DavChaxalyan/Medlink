# Medlink

**Medlink** is a foundational project developed using Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS, aimed at showcasing the capabilities of modern web development technologies and design. This project serves as a medical website with multiple pages, including an error page that displays a "Page Not Found" message, making it user-friendly and intuitive.

## Technologies

- **Vue 3**: Utilizes the Composition API for building components, enhancing code readability and organization.
- **Vue Router**: Implements routing to create a multi-page interface, allowing users to easily navigate between different pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Employs a utility-first approach to styling, enabling quick and efficient creation of responsive and visually appealing interfaces.
